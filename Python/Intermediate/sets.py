# What is Sets in Python?
'''A set is a collection of unique and unordered elements. Sets are useful when you need to store multiple items,
but you only want each item to appear once. They are defined by enclosing elements in curly braces {} or using
the set() function.'''

# Key Features
# Unordered:
'''The elements in a set do not have a defined order.'''
# Immutable Elements:
'''Elements of a set must be immutable (e.g., numbers, strings, tuples), but the set itself is mutable.'''
# No Duplicates:
'''Sets automatically handle duplicates by storing only one occurrence of each element.'''
